# Occlusion-python
This repo contains code that was used to control <a href="http://www.translucent.ca/products/plato-visual-occlusion-spectacles/">PLATO</a> occlusion goggles in a visual training experiment conducted at Texas Tech University.
The results of this study are published <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1541931213601859">here</a>.

The code was written to work natively with our in-house experiment presentation software. During the experiment, a spacebar press would start the next trial and initiate the strobe sequence on the goggles. A mouse click recorded the participant response in the software, and close the goggles until the next trial is started.
